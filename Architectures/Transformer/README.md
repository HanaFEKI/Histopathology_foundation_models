# üîπ Transformer Encoder-Decoder Implementation

This repository provides a **PyTorch implementation of a full Transformer model** with encoder-decoder architecture, inspired by the original *‚ÄúAttention is All You Need‚Äù* paper. It can be used for sequence-to-sequence tasks, including text translation, masked image modeling, or reconstruction tasks in domains like histopathology.

## üîπ Overview

The Transformer architecture replaces recurrent and convolutional networks with **attention mechanisms**, allowing:

- **Parallel computation** over sequences  
- **Long-range dependency modeling**  
- **Flexible encoder-decoder structure** for seq2seq tasks  

This implementation includes:

1. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**
2. **Feed-Forward Network**
3. **Layer Normalization + Residual connections**
4. **Stackable Encoder and Decoder layers**
5. **Learnable positional embeddings**
6. **Output projection for target vocabulary or reconstruction**

## üîπ Architecture Details

### 1. Multi-Head Attention
- Splits embeddings into multiple heads  
- Computes **scaled dot-product attention** for each head  
- Concatenates outputs and applies a linear projection  

### 2. Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
- Two linear layers with **GELU activation**  
- Provides non-linear transformation of features  

### 3. Encoder Layer
- **Self-attention ‚Üí Add & Norm ‚Üí FFN ‚Üí Add & Norm**  
- Captures relationships between tokens in the **input sequence**

### 4. Decoder Layer
- **Masked self-attention** for target sequence  
- **Cross-attention** with encoder outputs  
- FFN + residual connections  

### 5. Positional Embeddings
- Learnable positional encodings added to token embeddings  
- Enables the model to capture **sequence order**  

### 6. Full Transformer
- Stacks multiple encoder and decoder layers  
- Returns logits over target vocabulary for each position  
- Can handle **variable-length sequences**

   - Machine translation  
   - Text summarization  
   - Question answering  

2. **Masked Image Modeling (MIM)**
   - Encoder processes visible image patches  
   - Decoder reconstructs masked patches  

3. **Histopathology & Medical Imaging**
   - Learn tissue representations from unlabeled slides  
   - Reconstruct missing or corrupted regions  

4. **Time Series / Multi-modal Data**
   - Model complex dependencies in sequences  
   - Cross-attention between modalities
