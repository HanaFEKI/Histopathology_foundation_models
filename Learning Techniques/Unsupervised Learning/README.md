# Unsupervised Learning

## Overview

Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning where models learn patterns, structures, or representations from data **without labeled outputs**. Unlike supervised learning, it does not rely on annotated data but instead discovers the inherent distribution and features within the data itself.

## Key Concepts

- **Goal:** Extract meaningful patterns, clusters, or features from unlabeled data.
- **Main Techniques:**
  - **Clustering:** Group data points by similarity (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN).
  - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduce data complexity while preserving structure (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, UMAP).
  - **Representation Learning:** Learn compact embeddings (e.g., Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders).
  - **Density Estimation & Generative Models:** Model data distributions and generate new samples (e.g., GANs, VAEs).

## Importance in Computational Pathology

Computational pathology uses computational tools to analyze digital pathology images and related data to assist disease diagnosis, prognosis, and research. Unsupervised learning is particularly important because:

1. **Handling Large Unlabeled Datasets**  
   Digital pathology generates massive whole-slide images (WSIs) which are costly and time-consuming to annotate. Unsupervised learning extracts meaningful features directly without labels.

2. **Discovering Novel Disease Subtypes**  
   Clustering techniques can uncover previously unknown phenotypes or histological patterns linked to clinical outcomes.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction & Noise Filtering**  
   High-dimensional pathology images can be compressed and denoised, improving analysis and visualization.

4. **Pretraining Deep Learning Models**  
   Self-supervised and contrastive learning methods enable models to learn rich features from unlabeled data, enhancing downstream tasks with limited labeled samples.

5. **Anomaly and Outlier Detection**  
   Unsupervised methods identify rare or unusual cases, aiding quality control and discovery.

6. **Integrating Multi-Modal Data**  
   Joint modeling of images, genomics, and clinical data helps reveal complex biological relationships for personalized medicine.
