# üß¨ Histopathology Foundation Models

This repository is inspired by the excellent review by [Bilal et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08333) on foundation models in computational pathology. It aims to be your **one-stop resource** for understanding and implementing foundation models in histopathology.

Whether you're a **student**, **researcher**, or **practitioner**, this repo will help you:

- ‚úÖ Understand the **core concepts** behind foundation models for medical imaging.  
- üîç Access **modular PyTorch implementations** of key models.  
- üìì Explore **real-life examples and notebooks** that demonstrate practical usage.  
- üåç Discover **beyond-histopathology applications** in broader medical vision tasks.

## Definition of a Foundation Model

A foundation model is a model that is trained on large amount of data (Most of the time multi-model), and then with the high-dimensional (e.g 2048 for ResNET50 encoder) features extracted, we add MLP on it to perform downstream tasks.
